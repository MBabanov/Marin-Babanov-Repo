            <p>ES offers an online electronic platform (the “Platform” or “Electronic Platform”) by means of which
                users can compete against each other when playing pure skill video games (also know as electronic
                sports or esports). ES does not develop or manufacture any skill video games and does not offer its
                own skill video games in the Site for competition but third party skill video games.[1] </p>

            <p>The Services provided with the Platform consist in ensuring the maximum safety and quality for all
                users playing and competing online on pure skill video games. ES Platform achieves such performance
                by managing and controlling the technical aspects of each game, this is hosting the game on its own
                servers, ensuring all players upstream bandwidth is sufficient, managing the same levels of
                downstream bandwidth to all players, same levels of latency to all playersrunning an anti-cheating
                and antivirus system detection, providing and enforcing just rules for the development of any game,
                providing unequivocal and automatic registration of all results, audit of results, users, winners,
                points obtained or real money earned, maximum control of points or real money deposits on users
                accounts, debiting or crediting points or real money lost or won in the games to each user account.
                ES provides all technical and functional elements so that the competitions are held with maximum
                guarantees and fairness and their results are exclusively based on the players skills. All the
                services above are provided in the same fair way to all players at the same time. However, players
                have to be aware that their own PCs and internet connections are different and may provide different
                levels of bandwidth, latency and other characteristics in every single case.</p>

            <p>ES does not calculate any odds on the matches or comment or have knowledge of the probability of one
                player winning a match versus another player, and makes no representations about an individual
                player's chances of winning. The games played at ES are dependent on the players pure skills and
                neither ES or any third party can place bets on the results of the matches using ES Services</p>

                user to download a ES’s PC Application to its personal computer (“PC”). Such Application will
                automatically recognize those pure skill games installed in the users’ PC, which are also available
                in the Site. The Application will recognize when a user chooses to play a particular game against
                other players on the Site, will launch the game locally and simultaneously on each player’s PC and
                will manage the multiplayer match with the Platform as explained above. The Application installed in
                the users’ PC will help on all the functions of the Platform which require exchange of
                communications with the users’ PC and the users’ locally installed video game. For such purposes the

                of any match. The user expressly consents to such video streaming and grants to ES all rights and

            <p>In exchange for the provision of its Services, ES will charge a fee to all players competing in its
                Site (“ES Fee”). ES Fee consists on a percentage of the Playing Fees played by every user on every
                match. ES Fee will be charged in points or in money depending if the Playing Fees are in points or
                money. ES Fee’s percentage may vary from time to time and from one type of game to another [x5]
                however, it will be at all times clearly indicated in the Site and before and after each game</p>

            <p>ES may also charge a fee or a price, depending on the case, for the sale of any physical, virtual or
                digital products or functions or services from the Site. In all cases, all fees and/or prices will
                be duly indicated in the Site and particularly before acquiring any physical or virtual product or
                service. </p>

            <p>All sales by ES to you of virtual or digital products, functions or services are final and ES will
                not refund any transaction once it has been made. If you live in the European Union you have certain
                rights to withdraw from distance purchases. However, please note that when you purchase a virtual or
                digital product, function or services from ES you are only purchasing a license to use such virtual
                or digital product, function or services and, therefore, the performance of our services begins
                promptly once your purchase is complete and your right of withdrawal is lost at this point. We

                service.</p>

            <p>When a user participates in a match, the Playing Fees played are immediately deducted or blocked by
                ES from his account balance. With the acceptance of this Service Agreement each player expressly
                instructs ES to hold on to each player’s Playing Fees until there is a final result on the match.
                Each player also grants an irrevocable authority to ES to pay the winner of the match with the prize
                associated with such match and only on the basis of the unique valid results, which are those
                published by ES.</p>

            <p>The prize or prizes associated to each match will be the total Playing Fees less ES Fees unless
                expressly indicated otherwise for any particular match. The amount of the prize or prizes for each
                match is displayed in the prize field for such particular game and varies depending on the game, the
                amount of the Playing Fees, the number of prizes, and the number of people playing in the match. ES
                may also offer Free Roll competitions where users can play for points and win a money or money worth
                prize sponsored by ES or any of its sponsors. ES Fees and any sales price in the Site are inclusive

    <li>That all personal data included in your registration form and user account is true, accurate and
        complete at all times and that you update it as and when necessary for such purpose.
    </li>
    <li>That you are the only one responsible and on full control of the email address provided to ES and that
        you review any incoming emails to such email account at least once a day.

        tournaments and skill gaming with entry fees and/or prizes in the USA are established by each individual
        state, not by the federal government and that is the reason of this distinction. In case you are a USA

            <p> This Service Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Malta. For any
                matter
                related to the interpretation or execution of this Service Agreement, the parties expressly waive to
                submit
                to any courts which might have jurisdiction over the subject matter, and agree to submit to the sole
                competence and jurisdiction of the La Valetta Courts. In case your local consumer laws establish the
                Courts
                of your domicile as the competent Courts, those Courts will then be competent although Maltese law will
                still be the applicable law.</p>
